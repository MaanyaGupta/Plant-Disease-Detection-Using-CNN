Plant Disease Classification Project ðŸŒ¿
This project focuses on classifying plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset of plant images, our model aims to identify and categorize various diseases affecting crops, such as apples, blueberries, and other plants, as well as recognizing healthy plants. The project includes training multiple CNN models with varied architectures to enhance classification accuracy, analyzing performance metrics, and selecting the best-performing model for practical deployment.

Key Features:
Image Data Preprocessing: Using data augmentation techniques to enrich training data and improve model generalization.

Model Architectures: Experimenting with different CNN architectures to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Real-time Prediction: Allows users to upload a plant image and receive a diagnosis, identifying the plant type and specific disease.


Project Goals:
Our project builds on existing plant disease classification studies but distinguishes itself by experimenting with multiple CNN models and optimization techniques to maximize accuracy and robustness. This work aims to support farmers and agronomists by providing a practical tool for early disease detection, which can contribute to improved crop health and yield management.
